## Compiler vs Interpreter

### Similarities

- Both are used to translate code into machine-readable format.
- Both are used to execute code.

### Differences

- Compiler translates the entire code at once, while interpreter translates and executes code line by line.
- Compiler generates an executable file, while interpreter does not.
- Compiler is faster than interpreter as it translates the entire code at once, while interpreter takes time to translate and execute each line.
- Compiler provides better error checking as it checks the entire code before execution, while interpreter checks each line during execution.

### Examples

- > C# is both a <strong>compiled</strong> and <strong>interpreted</strong> language. It is compiled into an intermediate language (IL) and then interpreted by <strong>the CLR (Common Language Runtime)</strong>. The CLR is a virtual machine that manages the execution of .NET programs. The CLR is responsible for loading and executing programs written in any .NET language. The CLR is also responsible for memory management, type safety, exception handling, garbage collection, thread execution, code safety verification, and compilation. The CLR is the execution engine for .NET Framework applications.

- > Java is both a <strong>compiled</strong> and <strong>interpreted</strong> language. It is compiled into bytecode and then interpreted by <strong>the JVM (Java Virtual Machine)</strong>. The JVM is a virtual machine that manages the execution of Java programs. The JVM is responsible for loading and executing programs written in Java and other languages that compile to bytecode. The JVM is also responsible for memory management, type safety, exception handling, garbage collection, thread execution, code safety verification, and compilation. The JVM is the execution engine for Java applications.

- > Javascript is an <strong>interpreted</strong> language. It is interpreted by <strong>the browser's Javascript engine</strong>. The Javascript engine is responsible for loading and executing Javascript programs. The Javascript engine is also responsible for memory management, type safety, exception handling, garbage collection, thread execution, code safety verification, and compilation. The Javascript engine is the execution engine for Javascript applications.

- > C/C++ is a <strong>compiled</strong> language. It is compiled into machine code and then executed by the operating system. The operating system is responsible for loading and executing programs written in C/C++. The operating system is also responsible for memory management, type safety, exception handling, garbage collection, thread execution, code safety verification, and compilation. The operating system is the execution engine for C/C++ applications.
